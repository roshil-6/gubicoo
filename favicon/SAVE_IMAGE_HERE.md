# 📥 Save Your CUB-COG Logo Here

## Steps to Add Your Logo as Favicon:

1. **Save the CUB-COG logo image** to this folder (`favicon/`) with one of these names:
   - `favicon.png` (recommended)
   - `cub-cog-logo.png`
   - `logo.png`

2. **Convert to ICO format** (for best compatibility):
   - Go to: https://convertio.co/png-ico/ or https://favicon.io/favicon-converter/
   - Upload your logo image
   - Download as `favicon.ico`
   - Save it in this folder

3. **Also create a root-level favicon.ico:**
   - Copy `favicon.ico` to the root folder (same level as `index.html`)
   - This is important for Google Search

## File Names to Use:
- `favicon.ico` (main favicon - ICO format)
- `favicon.png` (PNG version)
- `favicon-32x32.png` (32×32 size)
- `favicon-16x16.png` (16×16 size)

## After Saving:
The HTML is already configured to use files in this folder. Once you save the image here, it will work automatically!
